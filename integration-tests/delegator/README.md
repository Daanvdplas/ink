# `Delegator` Smart Contract

The `Delegator` smart contract is our showcase for executing other smart
contracts on-chain. The key difference with the other `multi_contract_caller` contract is now the
"called" contracts are already instantiated, in stead of instantiating the contracts at the same
time as the `Delegator` contract.
